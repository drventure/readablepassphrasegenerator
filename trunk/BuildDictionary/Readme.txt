BuildDictionary and WordScraper utilities for ReadablePassphraseGenerator

Usage:

First, extract the base dictionary files to the current directory by running:

	BuildDictionary --extract

This will create several XML files in the current directory, one for each of the
different parts of speech supported.
For instance, after running the above command, you should see an "adjectives.xml",
"nouns.xml", etc files created.

At this point, you can edit those individual files, or even create new files 
(using the same basic XML formatting rules as used in the existing files).




-----------
WordScraper
-----------

WordScraper is used to generate a list of random, "made up" words using the 
awesome website thisworddoesnotexist.com.

Simply run it:

	WordScraper

It will running, showing you it's progress. You need to be connected to the internet
for it to work properly.

When finished, you'll now see several additional XML files in the current directory.

WordScraper creates a seperate XML file for the different parts of speech that it 
generates. You should see

	GeneratedAdjectives.xml
	GeneratedAdverbs.xml
	GeneratedNouns.xml
	GeneratedPluralNouns.xml
	GeneratedVerbs.xml

You may also notice a "GeneratedWords.txt" file.

This file contains the raw, generated word list. You can use or delete this file,
but it is not used by these programs.



-----------------------
Back to BuildDictionary
-----------------------

Now that you've generated some made up (but fairly realistic sounding) words, it's
time to use them.

Make sure that all the xml word files are in the same folder as BuildDictionary, including:
	1. those extracted using "BuildDictionary --extract"
	2. those that you've edited or created by hand
	3. those that have been generated by WordScraper

Then run:

	BuildDictionary --build

This will create the final custom dictionary file called "dictionary.xml" in the current folder.

This is the file that you can point to as a "custom dictionary" in the ReadablePassPhrase keepass
plugin configuration screen.
